# Hi, I am Brendan (EspressoGuardian) 👋

📍 Netherlands | 🤖 Learn as I go, hands-on multi-agent builder | 🚀 Ex-Customer Success turned Indie Game Dev.

> "Orchestrating a swarm of agents to build a deterministic indie future. After years in Technical Customer Success designing scalable workflows for others, I’m now applying those same principles—determinism, automation, and offline-first safety—to my own game studio. Currently vibe-coding at the intersection of GDScript and LLM-centric developer tools."

## 🍭 Projects

- **hubsays.com** (Closed Source): The flagship studio project.
- **Amber State**: A high-fidelity strategy simulation focused on deterministic causality.

## 🧰 Toolbox

- 🛡️ **shell-guard**: Git safety hooks for the paranoid.
- 🔍 **godot-secrets-scan**: PRE-staging PII & API key scanner for Godot projects.
- 🔧 **Amber Sentinel**: (Coming soon) Deterministic state monitoring for Godot.

## ⚖️ Principles

- **Offline-first**: Privacy as the default state. No telemetry.
- **Determinism**: Traceable, reproducible logic only. No wall-clock in gameplay.
- **Scope Lock**: Intentional feature containment via the "Scope Gate" protocol.
